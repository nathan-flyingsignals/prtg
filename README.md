Modbus Sensor
Modbus", "PRTG", "sensor", "Python", etc.
This MODBUS sensor is written to query holding registers on using registers configured for a Caterpillar ECMP for generator controller. Just find you manufcaturers MODBUS register list and query type and modify accordingly. The data is dumped via JSON to a format understood by the PRTG Scripts V2 sensor . I plan to write something similar for otehr industrial protocols as the need arises. Enjoy
